Passbolt Windows Application 2.6.0 introduces secret history, a highly demanded feature that gives users visibility and control over previous versions of their secrets. This release also includes several usability improvements requested and bug fixes reported by the community.

## Secret history

It is now possible to access previous revisions of a secret directly from Passbolt. 

Secret history helps reduce the impact of human error and offers a safer way to manage evolving secrets. For instance, this enables users to undo an accidental update on the spot. Note that the feature is disabled by default and requires an administrator to enable it from the administration workspace.

## User and group workspace improvements

A new “Remove from group” action has been added to the user and group workspace. This addition eliminates the confusion between permanently deleting a user and simply removing them from a specific group. 

Moreover, administrators can now instantly filter users that require attention via the “Attention Required” filter in the workspace. For instance: identifying users with a pending account recovery request to review, or missing metadata keys.

## Import report 

The application now displays a summary dialog after an import, offering accurate and actionable information. The report precisely categorises alerts into successes, warnings and errors, providing end users with additional logs.

## Miscellaneous Improvements

As usual this release is packed with improvements and bug fixes reported by the community. Notably, the reliability of autofill has been improved across a wider range of websites. If you find that autofill does not work on a particular website, feel free to open a bug report with the website details so we can investigate the issue. For more, check out the changelog below.

Many thanks to everyone who provided feedback, reported issues, and helped refine these new features.
