## Building the application

To build the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the solution file `passbolt-windows.sln` in Visual Studio.
3. In the Solution Explorer, right-click on the project and select "Manage NuGet Packages".
4. Search for "Microsoft.Web.WebView2" and install it.
5. Press F5 to build and run the application.

## Packaging the application

### Building with Visual code

To create a package for the application, follow these steps:

1. In Visual Studio, right-click on the project and select "Store" > "Create App Packages".
2. Follow the wizard to create a package for the app.
3. The package will be saved to the output directory of your project.

### Building with Command Line

To build the Passbolt Desktop App using the command line, you can use the MSBuild command-line tool, which is included with Visual Studio. Follow these steps to build the app using the command line:

1. Open a command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the following command to build the solution:

``MSBuild /t:Restore;Build /p:Configuration=Release;Platform=x64``

This command restores the NuGet packages and builds the solution in Release mode for the x64 platform.

3. After the build completes, the app package will be available in the `bin\x64\Release` directory.

## Running tests

### Running tests with Visual code

Passbolt Desktop App includes a suite of unit tests to ensure that the app functions correctly. To run the unit tests, follow these steps:

1. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
2. In the Solution Explorer, right-click on the `PassboltDesktopApp.UnitTests` project and select "Run Tests".
3. The unit tests will run, and the results will be displayed in the Test Explorer.

### Running tests with command lines

To run the Passbolt Desktop App unit tests using the command line, you can use the dotnet test command. Follow these steps to run the tests using the command line:

1. Open a command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the following command to restore the NuGet packages:

``MSBuild /t:Restore``

3. Run the following command to build the solution:

``MSBuild /t:Build /p:Configuration=Release``

4. Run the following command to run the unit tests:

``MSBuild /t:VSTest /p:VSTestPath=<Path to vstest.console.exe> /p:VSTestArguments="/Settings:<Path to appsettings.json> /Logger:trx" /p:Configuration=Release``

This command runs the unit tests in Release mode and generates a test results file named PassboltDesktopApp.UnitTests.trx.

After the tests complete, you can view the results in Visual Studio or any other tool that supports TRX format.

## Checking for Outdated .NET NuGet Dependencies in Visual Studio
1. Open your project in Visual Studio.
2. In the Solution Explorer, right-click on the project and select "Manage NuGet Packages".
3. In the NuGet Package Manager, click on the "Updates" tab to see a list of all available updates for your NuGet packages.
4. You can use this information to determine if any of your NuGet packages need to be updated.

## Deploying the application

To deploy the application, you can distribute the package file or upload it to the [Microsoft Store](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/packaging-tool/create-app-package-with-packaging-tool#step-6-upload-your-package-to-the-store). For more information on deploying UWP apps, refer to the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/desktop/source-code-overview).
